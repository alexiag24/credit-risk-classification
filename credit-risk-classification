## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The purpose of the analysis is to be able to determine whether a loan would be healthy or non healthy/ risk or no risk.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
In this data we had information on how to determine if a loan would be able to be paid back and what risks there was to loan with a healthy or non healthy account.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
The first machine model did have errors and was able to predict a good amount of healthy and non healthy loans but did create mistakes. It got 18,765 correct but 102 incorrectly as healthy when there were not. With the non healthy it correctly got 563 and 56 incorrect when there was a total of 619 non healthy loans.


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
With the second model we were able to change the accuracy from 91 to 99%
with being able to catch more mistakes it made the model better to use and can see better results in seeing the difference between healthy and non healthy loans.
## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

Obviously the second model would be so much better to use since it has a more accurate rate and can distinguish between low and high risk loans. Being better at approving loans and feeling safe and confident in the choice of whether to do business with an individual or not.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
